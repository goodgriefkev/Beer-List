# Known bugs/incomplete functionality:
* 'delete' button is not removing items from user list
* in details view if no data is available for a category then 'undefined' is displayed
* adding to user list not functional on mobile platforms
* details toggle animation is wonky, especially on show


# Features to add or tweak:
* expand search options to breweries and styles
* add brewery info to details view
* toggle beer details on/off for individual beers in both results and user list
* if a beer is added to user list, it will be removed from displayed search results
